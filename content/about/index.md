Hi my name is Masamune. Iâ€™m a noob player from HCMC University of Technology.

Dedicate to Cybersecurity, specialize in Web Exploitation, and also a little bit of coding algorithms.

This blog will be the place to share my journey to learn and play CTF during University time.
If you're interested, you can make friends via my discord **Masamune**.
If you have a question about me or else, just send a letter.
